# M3 Suggested Weekend Practice

## Weekend 1 Suggested Items To Work On

### Review from Week 1:
1. [Activity Finder](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/activity_finder) -- Consuming an API challenge. 
2. [Consuming APIs Practice](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/m3_exercises) -- This practice focuses on the process of making a Faraday connection, and getting data from APIs. Specifically, it works on creating services.
3. [Parks Finder](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/parks_finder) -- Although this is prep for the mid mod, the mid mod will also be on consuming APIs. Y’all just got some practice with that this week! So, believe it or not, you’re ready to put those skills back into action with this practice mid mod. 

### Prep for Week 2:
1. Review [Namespacing](https://backend.turing.edu/module3/archive/lessons/namespacing) -- As you get into your next project, namespacing will become handy. Take some time this weekend to review Namespacing and why it's used. 
2. Read over [JSON for API Development](https://backend.turing.edu/module3/notes/json_for_api_development.html) -- We'll be creating APIs that render JSON. Do some prep work to understand what JSON is, and what the [specifications](https://jsonapi.org/) are.
3. Review [Building an API](https://backend.turing.edu/module3/lessons/building_a_rails_api) -- read through Monday's lesson on building an API. A little prep before the lesson, will help you get the most out of the class! Come prepared with questions you have, and make sure they get answered by the end of class.  
4. [Students and Cohorts API](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/students_and_cohorts_api) -- A bulding API challenge. If you've reviewed Building an API, looked over the lesson, and want to try it out, this is a great repo to try it with. 


## Weekend 2 Suggested Items To Work On

### Review from Week 2:
1. AR challenge - If you did not get to finish the AR review and try out the AR challenge, please find time this weekend to do just that. Directions are linked in the calendar event from Friday. 
2. With any feedback you got on Rails Engine Lite, refactor your project. You can send Mike and myself a link to your repo, and tell us where to look, and we can get you more feedback sometime next week.
3. [Students and Cohorts API](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/students_and_cohorts_api) - Building an API practice (beginner to mid level of difficulty), directions are in readme. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-VRF8ouAYov5lVOMkLmigmG7vc-8ohhb/view?usp=sharing) is a review of this challenge. 

### Prep for Week 3:
1. Review your Viewing Party Projects -- we will look at them again on Monday. There will be an option to use a starter repo for the challenges throughout the week, but we suggest you use your own project. (Functionality for creating a viewing party is not necessary for the challenges that you'll be trying out)
2. Do a little research on Cookies and Sessions. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64veb6tKTm0) is a nice video to get you started.
3. Do a little research on Service Oriented Architecture. [Here](https://www.google.com/search?q=service+oriented+architecture+for+beginners&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS951US952&tbm=vid&sxsrf=ALiCzsYVJ-v0F6KxhqDsMB5A4qxUtugoMg:1670537303383&ei=V2CSY9f_FvS70PEPqsiCqA0&start=10&sa=N&ved=2ahUKEwiXh7W0hOv7AhX0HTQIHSqkANUQ8tMDegQIFBAE&biw=1706&bih=894&dpr=1#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:e8e47e15,vid:7s_S5Hkm7z0) is a nice video to get you started.
4. Find a challenge on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all). (I suggest an 'easy' one, as they can be quite difficult), timebox yourself to an hour, and see if you can complete it. (Note: I'll usually read through the challenge and perform it in a text editor that's familiar to me. Then, when I think I have a solution, I'll paste my code in the IDE and run it to see if it passes Leetcode's expectation).

### Pitch an Idea! 
Get ready to pitch an idea for the Consultancy project. Take a look over [this doc](https://backend.turing.edu/module3/projects/consultancy/ideation) to get some ideas, and understand how to best come prepared to pitch a project.
