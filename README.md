# M3 Suggested Weekend Practice

## Weekend 1 Suggested Items To Work On

### Review from Week 1:
1. [Activity Finder](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/activity_finder) -- A new consuming API challenge. 
2. [Consuming APIs Practice](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/m3_exercises) -- This practice focuses on the process of making a Faraday connection, and getting data from APIs. Specifically, it works on creating services.
3. [Parks Finder](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/parks_finder) -- Although this is prep for the mid mod, the mid mod will also be on consuming APIs. Y’all just got some practice with that this week! So, believe it or not, you’re ready to put those skills back into action with this practice mid mod. 

### Prep for Week 2:
1. Review [Namespacing](https://backend.turing.edu/module3/archive/lessons/namespacing) -- As you get into your next project, namespacing will become handy. Take some time this weekend to review Namespacing and why it's used. 
2. Read over [JSON for API Development](https://backend.turing.edu/module3/notes/json_for_api_development.html) -- We'll be creating APIs that render JSON. Do some prep work to understand what JSON is, and what the [specifications](https://jsonapi.org/) are.
3. Review [Building an API](https://backend.turing.edu/module3/lessons/building_a_rails_api) -- read through Monday's lesson on building an API. A little prep before the lesson, will help you get the most out of the class! Come prepared with questions you have, and make sure they get answered by the end of class.  
4. [Students and Cohorts API](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/students_and_cohorts_api) -- A bulding API challenge. If you've reviewed Building an API, looked over the lesson, and want to try it out, this is a great repo to try it with.
